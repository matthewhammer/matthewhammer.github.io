<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
In computer systems, the interaction of computations and data often
causes incremental changes, not wholesale ones. 

Hence, there exists the possibility of improving the efficiency of a
system by recording and reusing computations, rather than blindly
remaking them anew. 

To this end, self-adjusting computation is a technique for
systematically constructing computational structures that evolve
efficiently and incrementally. 

Past work has explored several facets of this programming
language-based approach, but no prior formulations have given a
low-level account of self-adjusting computation. 

By low-level, we mean an account where machine resources are defined
and managed explicitly, e.g., as in the C programming language.
</p>
<p>
We offer self-adjusting machines, a concept based on an operational
interpretation of self-adjusting computation with explicit machine
resources. 

By making their resources explicit, self-adjusting machines give an
operational account of self-adjusting computation suitable for
interoperation with low-level languages; via practical compilation and
run- time techniques, these machines are programmable, sound and
efficient.
</p>
<p>
Abstractly, we formally define self-adjusting machines that run an
intermediate language; we prove that this abstract machine semantics
is sound. 

Concretely, we give techniques based on this semantics that construct
self-adjusting machines by compiling a C-like surface language into C
target code that runs within an extensible, C-based run-time
system. 

By creating new programming abstractions, library programmers can
extend this C-based system with new self-adjusting behavior. 

We demonstrate that this extension framework is powerful by using it
to express a variety of both new and old self-adjusting
abstractions. 

We give an empirical evaluation showing that our approach is efficient
and well-suited for programming space and time-efficient
self-adjusting computations.
