<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
 Self-adjusting computation offers a language-centric approach to
 writing programs that can automatically respond to modifications to
 their data (e.g., inputs).  Except for several domain-specific
 implementations, however, all previous implementations of
 self-adjusting computation assume mostly functional, higher-order
 languages such as Standard ML.  Prior to this work, it was not known
 if self-adjusting computation can be made to work with low-level,
 imperative languages such as C without placing undue burden on the
 programmer.
</p>
<p>
 We describe the design and implementation of CEAL: a C-based language
 for self-adjusting computation.  The language is fully general and
 extends C with a small number of primitives to enable writing
 self-adjusting programs in a style similar to conventional C
 programs.  We present efficient compilation techniques for
 translating CEAL programs into C that can be compiled with existing C
 compilers using primitives supplied by a run-time library for
 self-adjusting computation.  We implement the proposed compiler and
 evaluate its effectiveness.  Our experiments show that CEAL is
 effective in practice: compiled self-adjusting programs respond to
 small modifications to their data by orders of magnitude faster than
 recomputing from scratch while slowing down a from-scratch run by a
 moderate constant factor.  Compared to previous work, we measure
 significant space and time improvements.
