<h1>Syllabus Statements</h1>

    <p>The University asks that the following statements be presented to students at the start of each semester.</p>

    <h2>Disability Accommodations</h2>

    <p>If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit to your professor a letter from Disability Services in a timely manner (for exam accommodations provide your letter at least one week prior to the exam) so that your needs can be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by e-mail at <a href="mailto:dsinfo@colorado.edu">dsinfo@colorado.edu</a>. If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions">Temporary Injuries</a> guidelines under the Quick Links at the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/">Disability Services</a> website and discuss your needs with your professor.</p>

    <h2>Religious Observances</h2>

		<p>Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments, or required attendance. In this class, <strong>(insert your procedures here)</strong>. See the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/observance-religious-holidays-and-absences-classes-andor-exams">campus policy regarding religious observances</a> for full details.</p>

    <h2>Classroom Behavior</h2>

    <p>Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran's status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. For more information, see the policies on <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior">classroom behavior</a> and the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/osc/sites/default/files/attached-files/studentconductcode_16-17-a.pdf">student code</a>.</p>

    <h2>Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination, Harassment and/or Related Retaliation</h2>

    <p>The University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) is committed to maintaining a positive learning, working, and living environment. CU Boulder will not tolerate acts of sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment or related retaliation against or by any employee or student. CU's Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibits sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, intimate partner abuse (dating or domestic violence), stalking or related retaliation. CU Boulder's Discrimination and Harassment Policy prohibits discrimination, harassment or related retaliation based on race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy. Individuals who believe they have been subject to misconduct under either policy should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at 303-492-2127. Information about the OIEC, the above referenced policies, and the campus resources available to assist individuals regarding sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment or related retaliation can be found at the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/institutionalequity/">OIEC website</a>.</p>

    <h2>Honor Code</h2>

    <p>All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/academic-integrity-policy">academic integrity policy</a> of the institution. Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access, clicker fraud, resubmission, and aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code Council (<a href="mailto:honor@colorado.edu">honor@colorado.edu</a>; 303-735-2273).
