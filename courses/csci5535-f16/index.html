      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
	This course introduces the fundamental principles of
	programming language design, semantics, and implementation.
	</br>
	For more information on the course philosophy,
	read <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/courses/ppl/phil.html">Why
	Study Programming Languages?</a> (written by Robert Harper,
	the author of our textbook).
      </p>

   </div>

    <div id="schedule">

      <h2>Lecture</h2>
      <p>
	Please see the <a href="schedule.html">schedule of lectures</a> for the
	lecture topics and links to the readings and assignments.
      </p>

      <p>
	Lecture is a primary source of information in this course.
	You are strongly urged to attend lecture every week, and are
	in any case responsible for the material presented therein.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div id="participation">

      <h2>Homework</h2>

      <p>
	Please see the <a href="hws.html">homework assignments</a> page
	for more information on submitting homework and for the current assignments.
      </p>

      <p> Homework will account for 50% of your grade in this course.  </p>

      <p>
        This semester homework will be submitted via Moodle. 
	Additionally, grades for assignments as well as feedback will
        be released on Moodle.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Exam</h2> <p> There will be an open-book, take-home
      final examination at the end of the semester.  This exam will
      account for 20% of your grade.</p>

      <h2>Course Project</h2>
      
      Roughly half-way through the course, students will begin to work
      in pairs (or independently, with permission from the professor)
      on a course project.  This project will consist of a combination
      of implementation work, theoretical work, and a literature
      survey.  The final meetings of the class will consist of project
      teams giving oral presentations about their project.
      Additionally, each project team is required to submit a written
      report.  See the <a href="proj.html">course project page</a> for
      details about the scope of these projects, and the requirements
      for presentations and reports.

      <h2><a name="grading"></a>Grading</h2> <p> Homework will account
      for 50% of your grade, the final 20%, and the project 30%.  Your
      final letter grade will be determined in part based on your
      performance relative to the rest of the class, though we have no
      pre-determined distribution in mind.  We will also consider
      extra credit on the assignments and participation in lecture
      when determining final grades. Extra credit and participation do
      not count towards your numeric average, but, for example, they
      might cause a student on the border to receive an A instead of a
      B (or vice versa!).  </p>

      <p>Late homework assignments will not be accepted or graded.
      They count for zero points. If you have a special circumstance
      that is truly beyond your control which prevents you from
      completeing your homework on time, contact the
      instructor <b>before the homework due date</b> to request a
      special accommodation.  Requests made on or after the due
      date will be categorically ignored.</p>

	The programming languages we study and use in this course will
	be closely related
	to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)">ML</a>.
	Specifically, we will use
	the <a href="http://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a> implementation for
	homeworks that involve programming assignments.

        <h2>Communication</h2>

        <p>
        Post all questions for the professor on
        the <a href="https://moodle.cs.colorado.edu/course/view.php?id=53">Discussion
        Forum</a> on Moodle.  However, it is <b>not</b> appropriate to
        post solutions to homework problems publically, for the
        obvious reasons, so if your question is about your own
        solution, please post privately to the professor only.
       </p>
    </div>

    <div id="help">

      <h2>Where to go for help</h2>

      <p>
      The <a href="https://moodle.cs.colorado.edu/course/view.php?id=53">Moodle
      Discussion Forum</a> is the first place to look for answers to
      your questions, and to post questions of your own.
      </p>

      <p>
      The second place to look for help is to visit the professor
      during office hours.  These times are intended to help you with
      homework and answer any questions you may have about the course
      material.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="rules">

      <h2><a name="integrity"></a>Academic Integrity</h2>
      <p>
	As a condition for taking this course, you are responsible for
	compliance with the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/academic-integrity-policy">University
	Policy on Academic Integrity and Plagiarism</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      In this course, you are authorized to use the books and notes linked
      from this Web site, as well as any other sources specifically allowed by
      the course staff.  Any other source is unauthorized.
      </p>

      <p> You are allowed to discuss homework assignments with other students.
      However, in order to ensure that the work you submit is still your own, we
      insist that you adhere to a <em>whiteboard policy</em> regarding these
      discussions: you are not allowed to take any notes, files, or other
      records away from the discussion.  For example, you may work on the
      homework at the whiteboard with another student, but then you must erase
      the whiteboard, go home, and write up your solution individually.  We take
      your ability to recreate the solution independently as proof that you
      understand the work that you submit.
      </p>

      <p> This policy is our attempt to balance the tension between
      the benefits of group work and the benefits of individual work.
      We ask that you obey the spirit of the policy, as well as the
      letter: ensure that all work you submit is your own and that you
      fully understand the solution.  This is in your best interest:
      the exam constitutes a significant part of your final grade and
      it will draw heavily on the terminology, concepts, and
      techniques that are exercised in in the homework.  It is
      unlikely that you will be able to do well on the exam if you do
      not take full advantage of the learning opportunity afforded by
      the homework assignments.
