      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
	This course introduces the fundamental principles of
	programming language design, semantics, and implementation
	of <a href="http://wikipedia.org"><b>incremental
	computations</b></a>.
	
	<i>
	  Incremental computations are those that run faster after small
	  input changes that naive recomputation of the updated output.
	</i>

	<p>
	To express incremental computations that are efficient and
	correct (or sound, meaning consistent with from-scratch
	evaluation), we will study designs that combine new algorithms
	and programming language abstractions.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  To understand these algorithms and PL abstractions in
	  practice, we will
	  use <a href="http://github.com/cuplv/adapton-lab.rust"><b>Adapton
	  in Rust</b></a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Course topics</h3>

    <div id="schedule">
      <h2>Schedule: Readings and programming tasks</h2>
      <p>
	Please see the <a href="schedule.html">schedule of lectures</a> for the
	lecture topics and links to the readings and assignments.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="requirements">
      <h2>Course requirements</h2>
      <p>
	The primary sources of information, and the students'
	responsibilities for this course, consist of:
	<ul>
	  <li> <b>attend all lectures and class meetings</b>, </li>
	  <li> having attempted (ideally, having completed) the <b>readings</b> and associated <b>programming assignments</b>,</li>
	  <li> actively participate in <b>class discussion</b> (both online, and in class
	meetings), </li>
	  <li> and complete a <b>course project</b> (to begin in the later part of the course)</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Participation requirement</b>.  Your grade in this class
	will largely be a subjective measure of your level of class
	participation during lecture, class discussions about readings
	and programming tasks.  This grade will reflect the
	instructor's subjective impression of your contributions.
        <i>To earn a good grade, you are required to attend lecture,
	and to participate in class discussions (on Slack).  To earn
	an <b>excellent</b> grade, you are required to challenge
	yourself (this is an individual metric, and is thus
	subjective).
	</i>
      </p>

    </div>

    <h2>Course Project</h2>
    
    Roughly half-way through the course, students will begin to work
    in pairs (or independently, with permission from the professor) on
    a course project.  This project will consist of a combination of
    implementation work, theoretical work, and a literature survey.
    The final meetings of the class will consist of project teams
    giving oral presentations about their project.  Additionally, each
    project team is required to submit a written report.  See
    the <a href="proj.html">course project page</a> for details about
    the scope of these projects, and the requirements for
    presentations and reports.

    <h2><a name="grading"></a>Grading</h2> 

    <p> Class participation (discussion about readings and programming
      tasks) will account for 50% of your grade, and the project the
      other 50%.  Your final letter grade will be determined in part
      based on your performance relative to the rest of the class,
      though we have no pre-determined distribution in mind.
    </p>

    <p>Late homework assignments will not be accepted or graded.  They
      count for zero points. If you have a special circumstance that
      is truly beyond your control which prevents you from completeing
      your homework on time, contact the instructor <b>before the
      homework due date</b> to request a special accommodation.
      Requests made on or after the due date will be categorically
      ignored.</p>

      This text is suggested as a general textbook for programming languages.  It is not required to complete this seminar course on incremental computation, but may be helpful for general background material on programming languages.

	The programming languages we study and use in this course will
	be closely related

	Specifically, we will use
	the <a href="http://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> implementation for
	homeworks that involve programming assignments.

      <h2><a name="integrity"></a>Academic Integrity</h2>
      <p>
	As a condition for taking this course, you are responsible for
	compliance with the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/academic-integrity-policy">University
	Policy on Academic Integrity and Plagiarism</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      In this course, you are authorized to use the books and notes linked
      from this Web site, as well as any other sources specifically allowed by
      the course staff.  Any other source is unauthorized.
      </p>

      <p> You are allowed to discuss homework assignments with other students.
      However, in order to ensure that the work you submit is still your own, we
      insist that you adhere to a <em>whiteboard policy</em> regarding these
      discussions: you are not allowed to take any notes, files, or other
      records away from the discussion.  For example, you may work on the
      homework at the whiteboard with another student, but then you must erase
      the whiteboard, go home, and write up your solution individually.  We take
      your ability to recreate the solution independently as proof that you
      understand the work that you submit.
      </p>

      <p> This policy is our attempt to balance the tension between
      the benefits of group work and the benefits of individual work.
      We ask that you obey the spirit of the policy, as well as the
      letter: ensure that all work you submit is your own and that you
      fully understand the solution.  This is in your best interest:
      the exam constitutes a significant part of your final grade and
      it will draw heavily on the terminology, concepts, and
      techniques that are exercised in in the homework.  It is
      unlikely that you will be able to do well on the exam if you do
      not take full advantage of the learning opportunity afforded by
      the homework assignments.
