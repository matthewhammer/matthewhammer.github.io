<h4 id="balance-property">Balance Property</h4>
<p>A consequence of the <code>noRedRed</code> invariant is that the longest path from root to leaf in a red-black tree is one that starts and ends with red and alternates between red and black in between. The shortest path is one that consists only of black nodes. Because of the <code>okBlackHeight</code> invariant, the number of black nodes on the shortest and longest paths is equal. Therefore, the longest path in a red-black tree (i.e. its height) is at most twice the length of the shortest path (i.e. its black height). Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Max Height] <em>∀<code>t</code>. <code>rb t</code> ⇒ <code>height t</code> ≤ <code>(2 * bh t) + 1</code></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In-Class Exercise.</strong> Prove:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Min Size] <em>∀<code>t</code>. <code>rb t</code> ⇒ <code>size t</code> ≥ <code>2^(bh t) - 1</code></em></li>
<li>[Balance] <em>∀<code>t</code>. <code>rb t</code> ⇒ <code>height t</code> ≤ <code>2(log(1 + size t)) + 1</code></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the height of a red-black tree <code>t</code> of size <code>n</code> is <em>O(<code>log n</code>)</em>.</p>
<h2 id="membership">Membership</h2>

<p>When not worrying about maintaining the balancedness of a binary search tree, the insertion procedure walks down a path in the tree making left and right turns as necessary according to the order property. Then, if the element is found nowhere in the tree, it is added as a leaf.</p>
<p>A naive approach is simply to add a black node at this final position, satisfying the <code>noRedRed</code> invariant but violating the <code>okBlackHeight</code> property. Another approach is to add a red node at this final position, satisfying the <code>okBlackHeight</code> property but violating <code>noRedRed</code>.</p>
<p>Instead, the idea behind the insertion algorithm is to color the new node red, possibly resulting in temporary red-red violation, and then to walk back up the search path fixing and propagating any violations upwards.

<p>The <code>ins</code> function walks down the search path, inserts a red node as the new leaf, and walks back up the search path calling <code>balance</code> to fix any temporary red-red violations.</p>

<center>
<img height="500px" src="balance_B_R_R.jpg"/>
</center>
<p>In code:</p>
<pre><code>balance : Color -&gt; Tree comparable -&gt; comparable -&gt; Tree comparable -&gt; Tree comparable
balance c l val r =
  case (c, l, val, r) of
    (B, T R (T R a x b) y c, z, d) -&gt; T R (T B a x b) y (T B c z d)
    (B, T R a x (T R b y c), z, d) -&gt; T R (T B a x b) y (T B c z d)
    (B, a, x, T R (T R b y c) z d) -&gt; T R (T B a x b) y (T B c z d)

    _                              -&gt; T c l val r</code></pre>
<p>The <code>balance</code> function fixes a red-red violation when processing a black parent node that contains it. If <code>ins</code> propagates a red-red violation all the way up to the root, there is no call to <code>balance</code> to fix it. Therefore, the last step in the insertion algorithm is to color the new root node black (which has no effect if it already was black). Alternatively, we could leave the root red if it has no red child.</p>
<pre><code>insert : comparable -&gt; Tree comparable -&gt; Tree comparable
insert x t =
  case ins x t of
    T _ l y r -&gt; T B l y r

## Contracts

Although it is great to prove properties of pseudocode on paper,
it is often useful to dynamically check that the input and output
behavior of a function is as expected.

One style of such testing is referred to as *design by contract*,
where a function may be decorated with predicates
(`Bool`-valued functions) that describe preconditions on arguments
that callers are expected to satisfy and a postconditions on return
values that the callee is expected to establish.

For example, the function

    \x -> e

may expect `x` to satisfy some predicate `pArg` and may intend
`e` to satisfy some predicate `pRet`. If either of these
expectations is violated at run-time, an error should be
reported (one that, ideally, can help to identify what part
of the program is responsible for the failure).

Below is one way to rewrite the above function with such
pre- and postconditions. Notice how this function is a "wrapper"
around the original function.

    \x ->
      let _ = if pArg x then () else Debug.crash "..." in
      let ret = e in
        if pRet ret then ret
        else Debug.crash "..."

The insertion algorithm is a bit tricky, so let's define
wrapper versions with contracts to gain more confidence that
the implementation corresponds to the analysis that we have
done on paper.

We start by defining some helper functions.

    check s p x =
      if p x
        then x
        else Debug.crash (s ++ "\n" ++ toString x)
    
    checkArg s = check ("ARG CONTRACT ERROR: " ++ s)
    checkRet s = check ("RET CONTRACT ERROR: " ++ s)

Now, we'll define versions of the previous functions (labeled with
a "`'`") that perform contract checks on each invocation. In practice,
we would probably want to include more descriptive error strings
to report upon failure.

The overall `insert'` algorithm expects its argument to satisfy
`rb` and returns an updated tree that satisfies `rb`.

    insert' x t_ =
      let t = checkArg "[insert']" rb t_ in
      let ret =
        let (T _ l y r) = ins' x t in
           T B l y r
      in
      checkRet "[insert']" rb ret

The precondition for `ins'` is interesting, because its argument
ought to satisfy all the red-black tree invariants except possibly
that the color of the root is red. The resulting tree has the
same `blackHeight` as the original tree and might have one
red-red violation. We'll omit the `bso` post-condition from
`ins'` (and `balance'` below) to save a bit of run-time overhead.

    ins' x t_ =
      let t = checkArg "[ins']" rbExceptRoot t_ in
      let ret =
        case t of
          E -> T R E x E
          T c l y r ->
            if x == y then t
            else if x < y then balance' c (ins' x l) y r
            else balance' c l y (ins' x r)
      in
      checkRet "[ins']" (\t' -> bh t' == bh t && maybeOneRedRed t') ret

    rbExceptRoot t = bso t && noRedRed t && okBlackHeight t

    maybeOneRedRed t = oneRedRed t || noRedRed t
    
    oneRedRed t = case t of
      E                             -> False
      T R (T R _ _ _) _ (T R _ _ _) -> False
      T R (T R l1 _ r1) _ r         -> noRedRed l1 && noRedRed r1 && noRedRed r
      T R l _ (T R l2 _ r2)         -> noRedRed l && noRedRed l2 && noRedRed r2
      T _ l _ r                     -> False

The `balance'` function expects the subtrees `l` and `r` to have
the same `blackHeight` and that at most of them has a red-red violation.
The resulting tree has the same `blackHeight` as a tree constructed directly
with the `T` data constructor rather than via the different rotations.
If one of the four rebalancing cases is triggered, then the resulting
tree `t'` has `noRedRed` violation. Otherwise, the (untransformed) tree
`t'` may have one. Therefore, the postcondition is `maybeOneRedRed`.

    balance' c l val r_ =
      let r = 
        checkArg "[balance']" (\arg ->
          (bh l == bh arg) &&
          (xor [  noRedRed l &&  noRedRed arg
               , oneRedRed l &&  noRedRed arg
               ,  noRedRed l && oneRedRed arg ])) r_
      in
      let ret =
        case (c, l, val, r) of
          (B, T R (T R a x b) y c, z, d) -> T R (T B a x b) y (T B c z d)
          (B, T R a x (T R b y c), z, d) -> T R (T B a x b) y (T B c z d)
          (B, a, x, T R (T R b y c) z d) -> T R (T B a x b) y (T B c z d)
          (B, a, x, T R b y (T R c z d)) -> T R (T B a x b) y (T B c z d)
          _                              -> T c l val r
      in
      checkRet "[balance']"
        (\t' -> maybeOneRedRed t' && bh t' == bh (T c l val r)) ret

    xor bs = List.filter (\b -> b == True) bs == [True]

Because pre- and post-conditions are evaluated on every function call
(and the predicates we have supplied are linear in the size of their
arguments), these versions run *much* slower than the original versions.

    > t = buildRandom insert 1000        -- fast

    > t' = buildRandom insert' 1000      -- slow

    > t == t'
    True : Bool

During program development, however, we are often willing to trade
performance in exchange for help with testing and identifying bugs.

Try introducing some bugs into the implementation in order to trigger
run-time contract violations.

Some languages, such as [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/), provide
extensive support for specifying and checking contracts. One might
imagine an extension to Elm that allowed us to write the following
more precise function types, which automatically get translated
to the wrapped functions we have manually written above.
Notice that, in this syntax, types are "refined" by predicate functions.

    insert' : x:Int -> t:Tree{rb t} -> t':Tree{rb t'}
    
    ins' : x:Int -> t:Tree{rb t} -> t':Tree{bh t' == bh t && maybeOneRedRed t'}
    
    balance' : c:Color
            -> l:Tree
            -> val:Int
            -> r:Tree{bh l == bh r && xor [ ... ]}
            -> t':Tree{bh t' == bh (T c l val r) && maybeOneRedRed t'}

Better still would be for the language to *statically* figure out that
these contracts will *never* violated at run-time and, hence, do not
need to be checked dynamically.

Alas, in this course, we will not cover *software verification* techniques
or *dependent type systems* that are able to reason about certain fine-grained
program invariants like these. But this is a longstanding and very active
area of research.

## Busting the Stack

It's great that we have a fast, *O(log n)* insertion algorithm...

    > buildRandom insert 1000        -- fast

    > buildRandom insert 10000
    RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded

... but the logarithm of `10000` is not very large, and yet we crash and burn.
What gives?

    > randomInts 1000
    ...

    > randomInts 10000
    RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded

Ah, the issue is with generating a large `List` of random numbers, not
with our insertion algorithm. Bummer. Stay tuned for more.
