      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Matthew Hammer, an independent researcher excited by <b>modern programming languages</b>,
        including their mathematical designs and practical implementations.
        </p>
        <p>As in the past, I continue to enjoy Rust today.
        </p>

        Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/dfinity/motoko">Motoko</a> 
        and <a href="https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html">Koka</a> offer exciting
        ideas and uses that have my attention today.
