<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Computational problems that involve dynamic data, such as physics
simulations and program development environments, have been an
important subject of study in programming languages. Building on this
work, recent advances in self-adjusting computation have developed
techniques that enable programs to respond automatically and
efficiently to dynamic changes in their inputs. Self-adjusting
programs have been shown to be efficient for a reasonably broad range
of problems but the approach still requires an explicit programming
style, where the programmer must use specific monadic types and
primitives to identify, create and operate on data that can change
over time.
</p>
<p>
We describe techniques for automatically translating purely functional
programs into self-adjusting programs. In this implicit approach, the
programmer need only annotate the (top-level) input types of the
programs to be translated. Type inference finds all other types, and a
type-directed translation rewrites the source program into an
explicitly self-adjusting target program. The type system is related
to information-flow type systems and enjoys decidable type inference
via constraint solving. We prove that the translation outputs
well-typed self-adjusting programs and preserves the source programâ€™s
input-output behavior, guaranteeing that translated programs respond
correctly to all changes to their data. Using a cost semantics, we
also prove that the translation preserves the asymptotic complexity of
the source program.
