<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
In secure multi-party computation, mutually distrusting parties
cooperatively compute functions of their private data; in the process,
they only learn certain results as per the protocol (e.g., the final
output). The realization of these protocols uses cryptographic
techniques to avoid leaking information between the parties. A
protocol for a secure computation can sometimes be optimized without
changing its security guarantee: when the parties can use their
private data and the revealed output to infer the values of other
data, then this other data need not be concealed from them via
cryptography.
</p>
<p>
In the context of automatically optimizing secure multi-party
computation, we define two related problems, knowledge inference and
constructive knowledge inference. In both problems, we attempt to
automatically discover when and if intermediate variables used in a
protocol will (eventually) be known to the parties involved in the
computation. Provably-known variables offer optimization
opportunities.
</p>
<p>
We formally state the problem of knowledge inference (and its
constructive variant); we describe our solutions, which are built atop
existing, standard technology such as SMT solvers. We show that our
approach is sound, and further, we characterize the completeness
properties enjoyed by our approach. We have implemented our approach,
and present a preliminary experimental evaluation.
